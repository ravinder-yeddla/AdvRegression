# Advanced Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 


## Solution approach
- The initial data is analyzed and exploratory data analysis is performed.
- Created the basic regression model and later created Ridge and Lasso models
- Found out the Lambda values for both models


## Conclusions
- Though the model performance by Ridge Regression was better in terms of R2 values of Train and Test.
- It is better to use Lasso, since it brings and assigns a zero value to insignificant features, enabling us to choose the predictive variables.
- It is always advisable to use simple yet robust model.
